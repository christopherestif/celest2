This document presents two demonstration of the software suite CeleST ("C. elegans Swim Test"), as part of the supplementary materials for the submission to PNAS called "CeleST: Computer Vision Software for Quantitative Analysis of C. elegans Swim Behavior".

Our code is meant to be run under Matlab 2011, by setting the Matlab path to the corresponding demo directory containing the file CeleST.m . The software is run by entering the command "CeleST" into Matlab Command Window. The directory containing the matlab source code is meant to be write-accessible by the program, therefore we recommend copying the entire directory of this demonstration into a writable folder (such as the user's desktop, or a temporary folder).


Due to the large volume of the data used in the article, it is only possible to share a small portion of the videos for review. To ensure that all the functions of our software may be reviewed, we have created two demonstrations, each using its own database:

1) CeleST - demo with videos

In the directory called "CeleST - demo with videos", the software is presented as it would appear to a first-time user, with an empty database. We have provided two example videos, each in its own subfolder inside the folder "demo videos". As described in the corresponding user guide, the user may enter each video into the software database, process it, check the results, and visualize the measures.

2) CeleST - demo with measures

In the directory called "CeleST - demo with measures", the software is presented as it would appear to a large lab group, with a database of over a thousand videos. Since the videos require too much space to be easily shared with cds or ftp servers, we have not included the video files, and we have disabled the corresponding functions in the interface. This demonstration is focused on the analysis of measures post-processing. As described in the corresponding user guide, the user may define their own samples of videos for display, statistical comparisons and export. Please note that for confidentiality reasons, the names of users, strains and experiments have been anonymized.
